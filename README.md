Minecraft mod for a more complete experience without constantly engaging with hostile mobs or not finding peaceful mode 
thorough enough (can't find or craft all items one gets as drops when killing hostiles).

The mod I want to play adds internal consistency, not so much "realism" -- overall reality does not actually make for good 
gameplay (or we would have no need for games ;), so I don't want to be caught up in it -- ie. making crops take a whole 
season to grow and having tasks be tough (and tedious) is not the goal here.  I want more consistency is because the 
most fun I had when I first played minecraft was in figuring things out, and I only got frustrated when I couldn't because 
the developers had not thought hard enough whether a recipe made sense within the game.  The wiki is fantastic, but I didn't 
actually WANT to use it, and only did so when I really got stuck.  For example, the Nether Portal -- impossible to figure 
out.  Heck, the fact that there is a Nether is not intuitively discernable.  I like the idea of having a game where you 
require very minimal instruction to get started, and where you can figure out how to create just about anything available 
in the game, if you think about it a little.  So in the long run I want to develop a mod where that is possible.  Eg. I 
might spawn nether portals, maybe in some villages, so people can stumble onto them, and then figure out what they're for, 
and how to create them.

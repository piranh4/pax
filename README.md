minecraft mod for a more complete experience in peaceful mode

for minecraft 1.6.4, using forge-1.6.4-9.11.1.923


2013-10-14

at this stage the mod is primarily meant to teach myself java and use good programming practices even when
modding somebody else's obfuscated code ;) -- and this is the type of mod i want to use myself when playing.
if i actually stick with it, i have rather grandiose plans, *grin*.  there'll be a sort of roadmap so you can 
peek.  first order of business is to change peaceful mode so the player gets hungry, and natural regeneration
is only in effect when the player has fully filled their food bar; just like it is in the hostile modes.  
there's also a set of "peace" stuff, for the sole purpose of me learning to make basic blocks, items, tools, 
armor, etc.

i am not prepared to give help to users, and won't guarantee what's pushed up to github is actually playable at
any specific time.  if you are looking for a mod that makes playing peaceful mode more complete without having 
to shift into hostile to kill mobs for specific drops, head on over to wuppy (https://github.com/wuppy29/WuppyMods), 
because his mods work.

brainstorming for pax minecraftia, a peaceful survival mod

this is not yet an actual roadmap ;)

general philosophy:

stick with the "spirit" of minecraft; ie. preserve emergent gameplay instead of enforcing my own philosophy, so people can still do whatever the heck they want.  which means, no making the game harder by taking away things like beds.  also, remember that "harder" and "more challenging" is different from "tedious".  i do not want tedious.  hammering away at a piece of wood for 5 minutes to make the game more "realistic" does not make for better gameplay.

the mod i want to play adds some minor "realism", but overall reality does not actually make for good gameplay either (or we would have no need for games ;), so i don't want to be caught up in it -- ie. making crops take a whole season to grow (and if your crop fails you die) is not the goal here. why i want more "realism" is because the most fun i had when i first played minecraft was in figuring things out, and i only got frustrated when i couldn't because the developers had not thought too well about a recipe.  the wiki is fantastic, but i didn't actually WANT to use it, and only did so when i really got stuck.  for example, the nether portal -- impossible to figure out.  heck, the fact that there is a nether is not intuitively discernable.  i like the idea of having a game where you require very minimal instruction to get started, and where you can figure out how to create just about anything available in the game, if you think about it a little.  so in the long run i want to develop a mod where that is possible.  eg. i might spawn nether portals, so people can stumble onto them, and then figure out what they're for, and how to create them.

i also think that various aspects of the game are seriously imbalanced, and i'd like to redress that.  for example, horses carrying chests outperform minecart locomotives with chest carts, and that's wrong; horses should be less powerful.

i have promised myself that i will not add a new item or new block that has only one use.  if possible, i will extend the uses for existing items (for example, use milk and dye to make paint; people used to actually do that).  i also think it would be neat if there were more than one way to make an item, and maybe have simple versions (that don't give you as much oomph) and luxury ones.  for example, one can make a bed from wooden planks and hay, but that's not comfortable enough to sleep the entire night, or maybe doesn't regen you fully, while the wool bed gives you a full night's sleep and all the regen you need.

finally, i would like to extend the tech tree.  i love what "better than wolves" has done in that regard, but i don't love the developer's philosophy, neither about gameplay nor about being incompatible with other mods.  i want to be compatible, which is why i am using forge, and when the minecraft API gets done, i'll move to that in time,  i am all for playing well with others, and i am also greatly in favour of making anything worthwhile into an option the user can configure.  emergent gameplay is THE best thing about minecraft, and i don't want to take away from that, ever.

but i need to start slow, since i am learning modding (and java) from the ground up, i have limited amounts of energy, and i want to get working bits right away.  so at first there will be just a few new recipes, and, of course, hunger will exist in peaceful mode, because that's what got me started considering writing my own mod (only after i started i found that wuppy had already done it, but by then i was hooked ;).

after all that tl;dr, here we go:

i need ways to get/make
- bones 
	animals could drop them upon despawning
	wolves could kill other animals in addition to chickens
	we could find middens near villages, or at the confluence of river and ocean
		other cool stuff could be in middens (flower pots, used tools, feathers…)
	digging in dirt could occasionally yield random bones

- slime balls 
DONE	glue from smelting bones
	slime blocks in swamps
	snails (new mob as in mo' creatures) could drop them
	cook okra (new plant)(only kidding)

- fish

- gun powder
	nitrate and sulphur ores

- ender pearls
	oysters could drop them (new mob/block)
	sand could drop them occasionally

- blaze rods
	occasional drop from nether rack
	wuppy uses a blaze tree, which i rather like

- ghast tears
	diamond surrounded by nether rack or vice versa (rra)
	wuppy's ore that drops a tear when lava is directly next to it while mined

- spider eyes
	drop from cobwebs

- rotten flesh
	wolves who kill animals, that drop meat which turns rotten just before despawning
	from bad oysters that don't give ender pearls
	"old" animals drop it when despawning
	craft from dung and steak/pork/chicken (or cook in cauldron)

- dragon's egg
- nether star
- monster spawner
- heads (skeleton, wither skeleton, zombie, Steve, creeper)

i'd like it to be possible to play in peaceful mode entirely without killing even animals = the vegetarian option.  not a necessity, mind, but a possibility.
- another fertilizer instead of bonemeal
	fertlizer is basically nitrogen (N) + phosphorus (P) + potash (K)
		find those as natural compounds?  what else can we do with them?
	could use silverfish stone to drop … calcium carbonate ?
	ammonia/urea
	compost
	nitrate ore (also useful for gun powder)
	kelp
	oyster shells
	animals drop dung (oh yeah, i like this one)
- sturdier cloth instead of leather 
	introduce linen
- something to drop slimeballs
	is cooking found bones offensive to vegetarians?  not this one. 
- shear fur to get animal bristle from pigs, horses, cows
- black ink
	soot and glue (originally animal glue, *sigh* -- could use pine resin instead
	iron and citric acid (apple?)
	walnut or acorns (ACORNS!  oak trees should drop these instead of apples)
- use milk to tame ocelots
	can we make cheese?
- feathers 
	chickens could drop those like they drop eggs
	you could shear chickens
	chickens could drop them when killed by wolves
		isn't that what happens now, or am i confusing it with a mod?

the amazing flax usability tree:
if we want sturdier cloth, we need
DONE	flax seeds
DONE		very occasionally drop from tall grass like wheat
		drop from tall grass when using a hoe
			the quality of the hoe affects the drop rate
from which we grow
DONE	flax (crop)
DONE		grows like wheat (8 stages)
which we harvest as
DONE	flax seeds
DONE	flax straw or fibre
recipes:
	flax straw + sticks = linen fibre
DONE	     or drop linen fibre straight from harvesting flax plants
NO	     (do we actually need the flax straw for anything? don't think so.)
DONE	4 linen fibre = linen block
DONE	sticks + linen = item frame
DONE	wooden planks + linen = bed
	linen can be shaped into "armor" like leather, with very little extra protection
DONE	flax seeds + wheat = whole grain bread (cures more hunger)
	flax seeds x 4 = linseed oil
NO		should we boil linseed oil before using it in paint?  would be more realistic.
DONE 	with linseed oil we could make a lantern
	linen + dye = coloured cloth
	linen can be shaped into wall covering (like carpet only for walls)

paint
PROTO	milk + dye + linseed oil
	blocks that can be painted:  wood, stone, any others?

paint brush
	sticks + animal bristle
	
alter some minecraft issues that i see as suboptimal:
- be able to make straight fire 
  -- two sticks make a fire starter, fire starter and logs make fire
     (that duplicates flint and steel, but we can make it a single-use item)
- make torches from sticks and said fire, and have them be temporary (tick handler) 
  -- if you carry one in your hand, it lights up your surroundings
  -- permanent light fixtures would be linseed oil lanterns, for example
- saddle recipe (leather and iron)
- mossy cobblestone recipe (vines and cobble)
- lots of things should be paintable/dyeable
- most every solid block should have half slabs and stairs to increase building potential
- introduce quarter and eighth blocks (and a handsaw to saw them)
- introduce facades/siding/wall covering
- lots more things should provide fuel
- some crafted blocks should come apart again (with some loss)
- more doors 
  -- more materials, and iron bar door, reed door, linen curtain (walk through even if closed?)
  -- umm. how about trees?
- don't hit trees to get wood at the start, hit leaves to get sticks
- have a set of flint tools available early on instead of most wooden tools (shovel ok, pickaxe not)
- spawn nether portals in ravines
- leave books in chests in village libraries that tell stories -- about nether portals, 	strongholds, mines, mooshrooms, desert and jungle temples, so people know there is stuff to look for.
- make ore-spawning more biome-dependent?  maybe only worth it if we have more ores.
- use the cauldron for something, like cooking multi-item foods
  -- it would be cool if one then needed to point an inventory item (like a bowl or bottle) at the cauldron to get the cooked stuff out.
  -- we'd need fire under the cauldron (see straight fire)
- make reeds usable similarly to iron bars (wicker/bamboo panels)
- create columns from stone, and wooden planks
- movement should be much more sensitive to the type of ground the player is on
  -- sand slows you down, smooth stone speeds you up, for example
- dyed sheep should not pass on the colour to their offspring
  -- quite possibly the dye should not survive shearing either
  -- but maybe we could have mutations so very rarely a funky-coloured sheep is born
- animals should eat your cultivated crops, depending on kind (pigs eat everything, of course)
  -- eating the crop should un-till the land
- have fruit trees instead of apples dropping from oaks
- the minecraft diet is not very healthy; no leafy green vegetables at all. ;)
- build a proper locomotive, with a GUI that allows adding water and coal, that pulls minecarts
  -- can pull more than one, decide on interface (use leads?)
  -- figure out whether we can overcome the out-of-chunk issue
- change the chests on horses so they have a smaller inventory than a full chest.
  -- chests on horses should make the horse slower / less able a jumper

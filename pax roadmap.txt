brainstorming for pax minecraftia, a peaceful survival mod

this is not yet an actual roadmap ;)

general philosophy:

stick with the "spirit" of minecraft; ie. preserve emergent gameplay instead of enforcing my own philosophy, so people can still do whatever the heck they want.  which means, no making the game harder by taking away things like beds.  also, remember that "harder" and "more challenging" is different from "tedious".  i do not want tedious.  hammering away at a piece of wood for 5 minutes to make the game more "realistic" does not make for better gameplay.

the mod i want to play adds some minor "realism", but overall reality does not actually make for good gameplay either (or we would have no need for games ;), so i don't want to be caught up in it -- ie. making crops take a whole season to grow (and if your crop fails you die) is not the goal here. why i want more "realism" is because the most fun i had when i first played minecraft was in figuring things out, and i only got frustrated when i couldn't because the developers had not thought too well about a recipe.  the wiki is fantastic, but i didn't actually WANT to use it, and only did so when i really got stuck.  for example, the nether portal -- impossible to figure out.  heck, the fact that there is a nether is not intuitively discernable.  i like the idea of having a game where you require very minimal instruction to get started, and where you can figure out how to create just about anything available in the game, if you think about it a little.  so in the long run i want to develop a mod where that is possible.  eg. i might spawn nether portals, so people can stumble onto them, and then figure out what they're for, and how to create them.

i also think that various aspects of the game are seriously imbalanced, and i'd like to redress that.  for example, horses carrying chests outperform minecart locomotives with chest carts, and that's wrong; horses should be less powerful.  i also want there to be incentive to build contraptions of all sorts.  in hostile people build mob farms to harvest xp and/or items; i want some form of farming (other than actual farming for food) to be useful in peaceful as well.  and i want to reward exploration.

i have promised myself that i will not add a new item or new block that has only one use.  if possible, i will extend the uses for existing items (for example, use milk and dye to make paint; people used to actually do that).  i also think it would be neat if there were more than one way to make an item, and maybe have simple versions (that don't give you as much oomph) and luxury ones.  for example, one can make a bed from wooden planks and hay, but that's not comfortable enough to sleep the entire night, or maybe doesn't regen you fully, while the wool bed gives you a full night's sleep and all the regen you need.

finally, i would like to extend the tech tree.  i love what "better than wolves" has done in that regard, but i don't love the developer's philosophy, neither about gameplay nor about being incompatible with other mods.  i want to be compatible, which is why i am using forge, and when the minecraft API gets done, i'll move to that in time,  i am all for playing well with others, and i am also greatly in favour of making anything worthwhile into an option the user can configure.  emergent gameplay is THE best thing about minecraft, and i don't want to take away from that, ever.

but i need to start slow, since i am learning modding (and java) from the ground up, i have limited amounts of energy, and i want to get working bits right away.  so at first there will be just a few new recipes, and, of course, hunger will exist in peaceful mode, because that's what got me started considering writing my own mod (only after i started i found that wuppy had already done it, but by then i was hooked ;).

after all that tl;dr, here we go:

i need ways to get/make
- bones 
	animals could drop them upon despawning
	wolves could kill other animals in addition to chickens
	we could find middens near villages, or at the confluence of river and ocean
		other cool stuff could be in middens (flower pots, used tools, feathers…)
	digging in dirt could occasionally yield random bones
	fossil ore?  those would be petrified bones, *snicker*.

- slime balls 
DONE	glue from smelting bones
	slime blocks in swamps
	snails (new mob as in mo' creatures) could drop them
	cook okra (new plant)(only kidding)

- fish (why did i put this here?)

- gun powder
	nitrate and sulphur ores

- ender pearls
	oysters could drop them (new mob/block)
	sand could drop them occasionally

- blaze rods
	occasional drop from nether rack
	wuppy uses a blaze tree, which i rather like

- ghast tears
	diamond surrounded by nether rack or vice versa (rra)
	wuppy's ore that drops a tear when lava is directly next to it while mined

- spider eyes
	drop from cobwebs

- rotten flesh
	wolves who kill animals, that drop meat which turns rotten just before despawning
	from bad oysters that don't give ender pearls
	"old" animals drop it when despawning
	craft from dung and steak/pork/chicken (or cook in cauldron)
  -- should we craft it ino leather?  that'd probaby just be circular

- dragon's egg
  -- i keep thinking that this should be a difficult task, equivalent to fighting the ender dragon, only in a 
     peaceful way.  like, taming it, but it needs to be complex.  maybe the ender dragon is injured and you need
     to brew a special potion, and befriend a pile of endermen to deliver it with you...
- nether star
  -- same goes for the wither.  i wonder whether maybe both should retain their ability to attack, just not have the 
     attacks concentrate on the player, but be more random.  just still dangerous, like a wounded animal might bite
     you because it doesn't understand you want to help.
- monster spawner
  -- this is here cause rra wants to build with it. i basically think that since you can get it from dungeons with silk
     touch that we shouldn't do anything special.  but if we make recipes for saddles, why not spawners?
- heads (skeleton, wither skeleton, zombie, Steve, creeper)
  -- find them in middens
  -- a villager could run a head shop.  ;)  then we should definitely add hemp to the game.

i'd like it to be possible to play in peaceful mode entirely without killing even animals = the vegetarian option.  not a necessity, mind, but a possibility.
- another fertilizer in addition to bonemeal
  -- fertilizer is basically nitrogen (N) + phosphorus (P) + potash (K)
     --- find those as natural compounds?  what else can we do with them?
  -- could use silverfish stone to drop … calcium carbonate ?
  -- ammonia/urea
  -- compost
  -- nitrate ore (also useful for gun powder)
  -- kelp
  -- oyster shells
  -- animals drop dung (oh yeah, i like this one)
- sturdier cloth instead of leather 
  -- introduce linen (or hemp)
- something to drop slimeballs
  -- is cooking found bones offensive to vegetarians?  not this one, but what do i know. 
- shear fur to get animal bristle from pigs, horses, cows
- black ink
  -- soot (coal) and glue (originally animal glue, *sigh* -- could use pine resin instead, or slimeballs
  -- iron and citric acid (apple?)
  -- walnut or acorns (ACORNS!  oak trees should drop these instead of apples)
  -- feeding squid could give it up
     --- feed them what? norally they eat small fish, crabs, and shrimp (which is not a vegetarian option).
- use milk to tame ocelots (which don't even seem to spawn in peaceful)
  -- can we make cheese?
- feathers 
  -- chickens could drop those like they drop eggs
  -- you could shear chickens
  -- chickens could drop them when killed by wolves
     --- isn't that what happens now, or am i confusing it with a mod?

the amazing flax usability tree:
(would there be any advantage to using hemp instead (other than that a villager could run a head shop ;)?
if we want sturdier cloth, we need
DONE  -- flax seeds
DONE     --- very occasionally drop from tall grass like wheat
		drop from tall grass when using a hoe
			the quality of the hoe affects the drop rate
from which we grow
DONE	flax (crop)
DONE		grows like wheat (8 stages)
which we harvest as
DONE	flax seeds
DONE	flax straw or fibre
recipes:
	flax straw + sticks = linen fibre
DONE	     or drop linen fibre straight from harvesting flax plants
NO	     (do we actually need the flax straw for anything? don't think so.)
DONE	4 linen fibre = linen block
DONE	sticks + linen = item frame
DONE	wooden planks + linen = bed
	paper + linen = book
	slime ball + linen = leash (weaker leash than the one made from spider silk?)
	linen can be shaped into "armor" like leather, with very little extra protection
DONE	flax seeds + wheat = whole grain bread (cures more hunger)
	flax seeds x 4 = linseed oil
NO		should we boil linseed oil before using it in paint?  would be more realistic.
DONE 	with linseed oil we could make a lantern
	linen + dye = coloured cloth
	linen can be shaped into wall covering (like carpet only for walls)

paint
PROTO	milk + dye + linseed oil
	blocks that can be painted:  wood, stone, any others?
	-- is painting even possible, due to block metadata being all used already?

paint brush
  -- sticks + animal bristle
	
alter some minecraft issues that i see as suboptimal:
- be able to make actual fire 
  -- look at how TFC does this
  -- two sticks make a fire starter, fire starter and logs make fire
     (that duplicates flint and steel, but we can make it a single-use item since we need it before we find iron)
- make torches from sticks and said fire, and have them be temporary (tick handler) 
  -- if you carry one in your hand, it lights up your surroundings
  -- permanent light fixtures to replace torches as they are now would be linseed oil lanterns, for example
- saddle recipe (leather + iron and linen + wood + iron)
- mossy cobblestone recipe (vines and cobble)
  -- it could also be cool, and a bit more challenging if mossy cobble spread from dungeons
- lots of things should be paintable/dyeable
- most every solid block should have half slabs and stairs to increase building potential
- introduce partial blocks, down to 1/8 or 1/16 (and a handsaw to saw them -- maybe have it work like chisel in TFC)
  -- might also be nice for building to have sheets like snow
- introduce facades/siding/wall covering
  -- find out how to make it occupy the same block from two sides in corners, like item frames do now
- lots more things should provide fuel (though really, nobody uses them anyway)
- some crafted blocks should come apart again (with some loss)
- more doors 
  -- more materials, and iron bar door, reed door, linen curtain (walk through even if closed?)
  -- umm. how about trees?
- don't hit trees to get wood at the start, hit leaves to get sticks
- have a set of flint tools available early on instead of most wooden tools (shovel ok, pickaxe not)
  -- i'd really like to redesign the whole tool chain, including recipes (cordage should come very early).  
     stone hammer, for example (stone/cobble + cordage + stick)
     iron hammer - iron + sap/pitch + stick
- spawn nether portals in ravines
- leave books that tell stories in chests in village libraries 
  -- about nether portals, strongholds, abandoned mines, mooshrooms, desert and jungle temples, etc, 
     so people know there is stuff to look for.
     --- tell a story that stuff you find in villages might not be the best way of doing things, since villagers are
         simple folk, *snrk*.  so we could introduce enchantments but not with the max book shelves, for example
- find some in-game ways to introduce people to things they can make that are non-obvious
  -- stuff that uses complicated recipes is non-obvious (cake)
  -- stuff that doesn't actually exist is non-obvious (enchantment system, potions)
  -- stuff that sorta exists, but not in this form is non-obvious (redstone items, pistons, sticky epecially)
- make ore-spawning more biome-dependent?  maybe only worth it if we have more ores.
- use the cauldron for something, like cooking multi-item foods
  -- use a GUI to interface with the cauldron or toss items in it?
     -- if we toss it would be cool if one then needed to point an inventory item (like a bowl or bottle) at the          
        cauldron to get the cooked stuff out.
  -- we'd need fire under the cauldron (see actual fire)
- make reeds usable similarly to iron bars (wicker/bamboo panels)
- create columns from stone, and wooden planks
- movement should be much more sensitive to the type of ground the player is on, like soul sand
  -- sand slows you down, smooth stone speeds you up, for example
- dyed sheep should not pass on the colour to their offspring
  -- quite possibly the dye should not survive shearing either, at least not forver
  -- but maybe we could have mutations so very rarely a funky-coloured sheep is born
- animals should eat your cultivated crops, depending on kind (pigs eat everything, of course)
  -- eating the crop should un-till the land
- have fruit trees instead of apples dropping from oaks
- the minecraft diet is not very healthy; no leafy green vegetables at all. ;)
  -- maybe in general food should make more sense; a loaf of bread or a cooked chicken lasts for a day
- build a proper locomotive, with a GUI that allows adding water and coal, that pulls minecarts
  -- can pull more than one, decide on interface (use leads?)
  -- figure out whether we can overcome the out-of-loaded-chunks issue
     (chickenbones has a chunk loader that handles this)
- change the chests on horses so they have a smaller inventory than a full chest.
  -- chests on horses should make the horse slower / less able a jumper
- nametags are so useful they should be craftable
- early food should offer more variety than apples
  -- have some nuts and berries
  -- find wheat (and flax) growing wild, instead of dropping seeds from tall grass
- analyze all foods to make sure there is a solid progression of regained health
- add thirst
  -- absorb water through the skin while standing/swimming in water, but at a lower rate than drinking it
  -- cure rate gets progressively better by drinking from: wooden bowl, water bottle, bucket (milk and water)
- i want the chisel from TFC!  OMG, so awesome.
- i'd like it if eating the red mushroom would poison you, and only the brown one made stew/soup
 

really, really long-term plans:
- improve villager trading AI
  (i am sorta waiting for mojang to do that, so this is just in case they don't)
- do something more interesting for peaceful folks with the end
- climate
- seasons
  -- animals take much longer to breed
     --- TFC has an animal interface where it tells you the animal's sex and pregnancy status
        (i am actually mildly opposed to introducing different sexes; i like the sexless aspects of minecraft)
  -- plants take much longer to grow
     -- fertilizing for more realistic growth conditions
     -- crop rotation 
- since "better than wolves" is finishing, implement the early tech tree from that (not like flower child owns human 
  technological history anyway, *snrk*.)
- plants and animals can get disease
  -- discourage monoculture and crowded conditions


"hard" limitations in current minecraft
- blocks can have max 4 bits of metadata (16 states)
- total block types in game 1024?  or 4096?  check.  it is better to use metadata whenever possible for any new blocks (unless they themselves have metadata)  kinda unelegant, but ...
- too many tile entities causes performance problems.  how many is "too many"?
- minecraft is moving away from using block IDs.  forge already doesn't like them. use objects instead.
